# Medical Text Classification with AI Techniques

Automatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that unlocks information embedded in healthcare narratives. It has been demonstrated that machine learning techniques work well for medical text classification tasks. Therefore, I have used several Machine Learning and NLP techniques to classify these important medical texts.




## Roadmap

- Collected dataset from Kaggle

- Reduced unnecessary categories

- Preprocessed data (Remove Stopwords, Punctuation , Emoji, Numbers etc.)

- Utilized TF-IDF for word embedding

- Used PCA for dimension reduction

- Employed Model : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, Polynomial SVM, RBF SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier

- Logistic Regression outperforms with highest accuracy
